# An Analysis of the Election Results for Colorado Board of Elections

## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections has assigned our client, Tom, to perform an audit on a recent election in the state. The audit requires the following information: 

* Total number of votes cast
* List of candidates
* Total number of votes received by each candidate
* Percentage of votes for each candidate
* The winning candidate (by most popular vote)
* Number and percentage of votes from each county
* Largest county turnout

Using Python, each of these requirements were met by printing this data to the command line and saving the data to a txt file. Click !(here)[PyPoll_Challenge.py] for the script. For the election data, click (here)[election_results.csv].

## Election Audit Results

As seen in the command line output, Diana DeGette won by almost 200,000 votes and received 73.8% of the votes. Denver had the largest turnout at the election, making up 82.8% of the total votes.

## Election Audit Summary
Political campaigns would have the greatest influence on elections by advertising in Denver County, where most of the voters live. This project could provide more insight by finding each county's percentage of votes for each candidate. This additional data could show the political leanings of each county.
